# Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

This project implements the **Floyd-Warshall algorithm** in Java, which calculates the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. 

## Features
- Computes the shortest path matrix for directed graphs.
- Handles positive and negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).
- Easy-to-understand implementation for educational purposes.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imad-chakour/floyd-warshall.git
   cd floyd-warshall
